# RDDs + Spark: in-class exercise ðŸ’¥

We will divide into groups to check in on our individual research, and solidify our understanding of RDDs and Spark. 

**Part I: ~20 minutes** 

Every group will be in a breakout room in Zoom. 
- First: assign a notetaker and a timekeeper for the group. The notetaker should open the class notes doc ([here](https://pad.riseup.net/p/7mHsw1gcEx28R7i4Ws_t-keep)), and the timekeeper can move the group along the following tasks ...
- Now: each person take a few min. **solo** time to write (on paper, or on notes on your own machine):
  - what are the key evolutions and improvements of Spark over earlier processing frameworks?
  - what are 1-2 questions you have about Spark and RDDs?
  - what are 1-2 current topics you are thinking about for your own research project?
- The timekeeper can transition the group after a few minutes of writing.
- Share your responses around the virtual "room"; the notetaker should add notes to the doc while the group is discussing. If you can clarify a question that someone in your group has, please use this time to discuss it.
- Note: the chance to share your current research thoughts could help you choose partners for the symposium project ...

**Part II: ~25 minutes**

- Now: take a corner of today's [Miro board](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/TExnVVdrWHFrZXpRUitRYjh4QmhBVG9MY3lEUTN5UXdYdTFLZFlENnVwY21pVlN4UXUzL3p2R1JEQ0ZPNmdZc2trK0JJcHZnb1FLME04b2lXWTVrWWRiMG5TVnhNQmdqQXYva0pCTlphVGszMEtiTnpTMDF0aHhxdmlybUpOSE50R2lncW1vRmFBVnlLcVJzTmdFdlNRPT0hdjE=?share_link_id=969598035677) for your group. You will probably need to start by creating a (free) account at that link.
- Each group will have a topic to expand upon for Spark. Choose a part of the Miro board where your group will work, and label that area with a group name.
- Take time as a group to use the board and explain this concept visually; how does this concept relate to _performance_ in Spark?
  
  - Room 1: narrow vs. wide transformations
  - Room 2: lower vs. high-level APIs
  - Room 3: lineage graph and DAG
  - Room 4: walk us through the last graphs from the paper, Fig. 12/13/14

Be ready to share your visualizations and explanation of your group's topic with the larger group!
