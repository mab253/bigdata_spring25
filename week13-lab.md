# ðŸ¦  challenges of image classification

In your group, for approx. 20 minutes, your task is to investigate the following images. *What are these?* Be **as specific** as possible. You can use any tools available to you, whatever you need to do. Take note of your top 3 identifications (or guesses) for each image, your group's confidence level of the identification, and the tools you used to find this. (If your tool has a confidence metric, you can note this down too.) 

This is also an exercise in _how we actually find information_ today, so pay attention to your group's process.

Some questions to discuss with the group (and later with the class):
- Which tools are most helpful?
- What challenges did you run into?
- Why is this hard for a human - and would this be a hard task for a machine?
