# ü§ñ week 0: welcome to big data!

To kick off the class, the following are due by **Friday, Feb. 7th** @ 11:59pm NYC-time:
- complete the [class survey](https://airtable.com/appLImpqyB4Mw1xtD/shrlaIUoyxLGvTaEy) password: ccnyprot25
- sign up for Discord (invitation code will come via CCNY e-mail)

First "hello world" post on the new Discord, due by **Friday, Feb. 7th** @ 11:59pm NYC-time:
- Introduce yourself briefly - you can let us know something you did over break, perhaps!
- Tell us a little about what you are interested in studying in the realm of big data. These could be topics you might want to do for your symposium + final project - check out https://github.com/mab253/bigdata_spring25/blob/main/symposium.md for some ideas. This should be about 1 paragraph.

# ü¶ã first weeks of class: async

This semester will start a bit differently - I will still be on a research vessel in the Southern Ocean (üßäüêß) until Feb. 12th! We also have some college closures, so we are going to do these first few weeks asynchronously. Your first assignment is to **begin the [Codecademy Introduction to Big Data with PySpark](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/big-data-pyspark)**. You can work on this online mini-course asynchronously at your own pace, and you will need to show a screenshot of the certificate of completion by **Feb. 18th**. NOTE that you only have to do the sections of this course that are free - you do not need to purchase an account. This course is in Python, and it also gives you an introduction to SQL via the library PySpark. 

Your other assignment before class on **Feb. 19th** is to read the [original paper on the distributed Google File System](https://github.com/mab253/bigdata_spring24/blob/main/readings/google-file-system.pdf), and some background on Hadoop (linked in the main syllabus doc). We are reading the original engineering paper for a reason - we want to dive into the complexity of distributed systems to get a deeper understanding of the foundations of big data, how the hardware interfaces with software to makes these systems work. Reading this paper might be dense and challenge - that is the idea! I encourage you to read this paper actively, taking notes as you need, with the goal of being able to describe the GFS/HDFS design to someone else. I am also including some (highly!) recommended videos that could help your understanding, to watch in parallel with reading the paper.

SO! For the first 3 weeks of the semester, you have 2 asynchronous assignments: complete the mini-course, and come prepared to discuss GFS in-class on Feb. 19th. See you then!
